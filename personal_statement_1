I chose to study electrical engineering and physics because I have diverse interests. I love the endeavor to physically understand everything that exists, but I also crave the practical applications of engineering and its associated problem solving process. My goal is to be a leader in the field of quantum computing.
*
In order to achieve this goal, I want to pursue a PhD in an area related to quantum computing at the intersection of electrical engineering and physics.

My experience in research and as an intern in industry as well as my coursework have shaped my desire to pursue a PhD. After my sophomore year of undergrad, I worked on electrical engineering research. I really enjoyed the process of approaching a problem, formulating questions in order to solve the problem, and then determining the best way to answer those questions. Last summer, I participated in an NSF REU program examining rotationally inelastic collisions between He and NaK or Ar and NaK. Imposing order on the chaos of the unknown was a very rewarding experience.

I also want to do something with meaningful, real world applications. This was my favorite part of the internships that I have had. After my junior year, I worked for Adaptive Methods doing signal processing work. Perhaps the most valuable lesson from this internship was the value of higher education in industry. The people who determined the direction of the next technical challenge to overcome all had post-graduate degrees. My goal is to make meaningful contributions to the field of quantum computing, and a PhD is a necessary step in this process.

My coursework has also prepared me well, in terms of technical knowledge and other skills necessary to succeeding in graduate school and beyond. I have had the opportunity to take extra computer science courses. The subject seemed interesting to me, and it gave me plenty of practice in independent learning since I had not taken the prerequisite courses and needed to fill in some of the gaps. Another skill that my courses have developed in me is my ability to react to an approach that didn't work as expected. For example, I received a rather poor grade in the first semester of a sequence of electricity and magnetism course. However, I knew that with different study approaches and a little more time, I could learn the material better and succeed in the subsequent course. I took the next course in the sequence, made the appropriate adjustments in my study habits, and I got a much better grade (A-).

The research done by this institution in these areas has this application to quantum computing. As a side note, it's also really cool because this part of physics/quantum mechanics/behavior of these particles fascinates me.  Becoming an expert in this area will enable me to be a leader in the development of quantum computing technology.
